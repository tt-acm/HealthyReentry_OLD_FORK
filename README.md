# Healthy Reentry

Healthy Reentry is a web app to track in-person encounters within an organization. Members of the organization can use their mobile devices or computers to securely track interpersonal encounters, and share their current [COVID-19] status with designated members of the Talent Team. The app keeps track of the contacts and alerts members if they may have been exposed to risk.

## Quickstart
The project is based on a few external services (Auth0, SendGrid, MongoDB). If you need help setting up that check the [detailed development guide](./docs/dev-details.md) and come back to this. The quickstart assumed you have all values for `.env` file configuration.  
- Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/ThorntonTomasetti/HealthyReentry.git`
- Navigate into the project: `cd HealthyReentry`
- Install modules for the project: `npm install`
- Update the env file with secrets and save it as `.env`
- Start the local server by running `npm run dev`
- Go to your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8081`

## Development
The app is built as a web app running an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server with a [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) front end and has been designed for use on desktop and mobile devices. It can be deployed on any server running [NodeJS]() and has been tested for deployment on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/).

## External Services

### Auth0
User authentication is not a part of the application. It uses Auth0 to handle that. [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/getting-started/overview) is a drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to your applications.  

### SendGrid
The app does not directly send emails. It can integrate with your choice of email service to send out emails for notifications and this version is configured for SendGrid. [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) provides customer communication platform for transactional and marketing emails.  

### MongoDB
The app needs to be connected to a database service to store your records. This version integrates with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and has been tested against [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).  

Feel free to fork the project and build out your own choice of alternatives for these services.
