            We respect your privacy. As we continue to monitor COVID-19 and its impact on our people and offices, it is important that designated members of our Talent Team are aware of COVID-19 related cases at our firm. To protect all of our
            employees, the Encounter application will allow you to securely and confidentially record:
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted mb-2">
            1. your personal COVID-19 status through a series of colors (green, orange and red).
            <br>
            2. your in-person interactions with fellow employees at work and/or during work events that do not adhere to the firm’s guidance on social distancing.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            We ask that you share your COVID-19 health status and potential exposures with designated members of our Talent Team so we can continue to make decisions based on what is best for all employees’ safety and our business. The information
            will <b>ONLY</b> be viewed by Lizette Agostini (Benefits Manager), Sarina Singh (Senior Talent Partner) and Dan Stauthamer (Chief Human Resources Officer).
